Overview:
A daily planner to track tasks and make sure you're on time by display color.  

Description:
This day tracker will have the following functions:
- a time slot for every work hour (9-5)
- a notes sections for every hour. This can be used for tasks, reminders, meetings, ect.
- the boxes will change color if the time is past, present, or future so you can insure your meeting all goals within the time youve set aside.

Plan of execution:
- create basic "nav bar" with only a "Planner" title using Bootstrap. 
- Link moment.js to get date in nav bar and to take the users time from their computer.
- create columns using bootstrap to define time slots, note slots, and a save function button/key.
- create a form for notes using HTML.
- use css to get page user friendly and easy to read.
- create an on-click function for the save button. Make sure form content is staying in local storage. 
- create multiple CSS classes to use for JavaScript.
- use JavaScipt and CSS classes to determine what color boxes should be based on the time.
